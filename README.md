# CS350EmergSysArch Reflection

### Summarize the project
 - The final project for this course was to design the code for a thermostat microcontroller that could read the temperature, turn the heat on, send temperature readings to a server, and adjust the temperature through the buttons on the TI board. The other part of the project was to write a design document for how the thermostat would connect to a server through wifi.

### What did you do well?
 - I chose to include the c file for my first milestone and the c file for my final project to showcase, what I think I did the best this course, which was improve. I remember getting really excited the second week (first milestone) when I successfully made the LEDs blink, and then by the end beign able to progam all of the requirements (with a lot of trial, error, and research is a vast improvement and progression of skill and knowledge.

### Where could you improve?
 - While I have improved a lot, I still have a long way to go with embedded systems. This is a topic that greatly interests me and I plan to continue to learn and improve.

### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
 - The TI family of boards and documentation is something that will be very helpful in continued research into embedded systems and combining software with hardware.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
 - Just generally the skills I have learned in the C language, and with researching information about products given the differences between the course material and the current versions of the software.

### How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
 - This has been my first experience with the original C language, and I still have a lot to learn with that so to utilize best practices, I tried to use widely accepted variable names, comments, and formatting (i.e. indentations and separations between functions) to keep my project maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
